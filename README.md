## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS including the var() function
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project, I learned it is possible to add more than one background image on an element as well as positioning it to fit your design. I didn't know this prior.

Something like this:

```css
main {
  background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
  background-position: -12em -40%, 14em 130%;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Multiple background images and positioning resource ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-background-position-property/) - This helped me for positioning the background images.
